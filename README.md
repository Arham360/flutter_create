# flutter_create

An application for the flutter create event

Author: Arham Raza Akbar

I got the inspiration for this application on dribbble (https://dribbble.com/shots/6202994-Fitness-App-Concept).

While I found a ton of other amazing looking mock ups, I didnt think they would fit the 5KB restriction so I wanted something
simpler but also catchy.

This app is designed to coach a person who is new to fitness but giving them a workout and telling them the number of reps they need
to complete and also, if needed, show a video of the exercise in question (app doesnt actually redirect to or show video). It is designed
to run on both iOS and Android devices and works in both orientations. But preferably use an android device to see the pop animation on back button pressed.

I initially implemented the app as almost identical to the final product as possible(original.mov in the assets folder) with count up
animations and a lot more detail. It was too big.

So I had to choose if I wanted to just implement one of the two pages, but I noticed that I could reuse the same class and put conditionals
everywhere. The results are the comparable to before with half the size of the code base. Unfortunately this
meant naming everything poorly and having less overall details in contrast to the original design. Also the lack of comments doesnt help either.

Only the workout tab is functional! UI Back button doesnt work!
Keep an eye out for the amazing hero animations on push and pop!

For the second page, I had a static youtube icon to denote tap to play video but I found it rather boring. I saw the flare
presentation during flutter live and I thought it looked incredible. Incredibly beautiful and since I'm not a designer,
incredibly hard. I was proven wrong. (https://www.2dimensions.com/a/arham360/files/flare/new-file-3)
