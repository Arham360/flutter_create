# flutter_create

An application for the flutter create event

I got the inspiration for this application on dribbble (https://dribbble.com/shots/6202994-Fitness-App-Concept)

While I found a ton of other amazing looking mock ups, I didnt think they would fit the 5KB restriction so I wanted something
simpler but also catchy. I also didn't want to use any external libraries.

This app is designed to coach a person who is new to fitness but giving them a workout and telling them the number of reps they need
to complete and also, if needed, show a video of the exercise in question (app doesnt actually redirect to or show video). It is designed
to run on both iOS and Android devices.

I purposefully kept as little assets in the app as possible as if this app were real, most images would be over web requests. I saw this
as an opportunity to use the fade in image widget at the expense of having the long url strings add to the file size. Both of these images
are from Pexels.com and are completely royalty free.

Only the workout tab is functional!
Keep an eye out for the amazing hero animations!

For the second page, I had a static youtube icon to denote tap to play video but I found it rather boring. I saw the flare
presentation during flutter live and I thought it looked incredible. Incredibly beautiful and since I'm not a designer,
incredibly hard. I was proven wrong. (https://www.2dimensions.com/a/arham360/files/flare/new-file-3)
